The vdeq-stream-condition-prediction repository is for making spatial stream network predictions of stream condition in the James River watershed in Virginia. The data come from Probabilistic Monitoring by Virginia Department of Environmental Quality that is used in a spatial stream network (SSN) analysis.
Independent data collected from 2019-2022 is used to test predictions of the spatial stream network model built based on 2001-2018 data.
